# Lavee Nails Appointment Booking App (Personal Project)
This is an appointment booking app for nails saloon named Lavee. I wirte this one using C# and Visual Studio as tool.
Expected features:
- Allow owner to input client's information to book an appointment
- Owner will able to manage the time for appointment. If there is a specific hours on specific date that is full of appointments, owner will able to use the Lock Button to lock that hour to prevent booking appointment in that hour.
- After input process complete, client's information should be connected and storage in a live database for tracking.

Future features:
- The app will be connected to a live database to function with client's information 
- Allow owner to pull up appointment information from the live database and view through the app.
- The app will be developed in mobile platform for convenient use.
